# python-challenge

PyBank:
The way i approched this challenge was to tackle a question at a time.
First i calculated the total months by creating a list and the using the "len" function. After speaking to a turtor during a session he shared a easier method of achiving the same results.
I was able to using the same method i acquired the total net.
I used the Xpert Learning assistant to ask question to guide me towards the right direction to get the profit/losses of the period and then adverage of the changes. 
The Xpert Learning assistant also assisted me by giving the function "-inf" and helped me figure out the formula to use to get the greatest increse and decrease. 
The output organization i used was demonstrated to me by a tutor. This method helped me keep everything organized.

PyPoll:
The strategy i used to solve this challenge was to tackle every question at a time and use the methods i learned in the PyBank Challenged.
To calculate the total votes i used the same formula i used in the Pybank problem. 
Working with Xpert Learning assitance i was able to work through and figure out the total votes each candidate received and the percentage. 
I work on outputting the information to my analysis but only the last candidate would pop up.
I worked with a tutor and he helped me figure out that i needed to put my formula in a for loop so all candidates would show.
The tutor demosntrated the output method  i used to transfer my data to the analysis.
